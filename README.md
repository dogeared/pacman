# Pure JS Pac-Man

This is based on the excellent work from [https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman](https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman)

The only major differences are breaking up the monolothic [pacman.js](https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman/blob/master/pacman.js) 
file into [modules](modules).

## Running

It's pure JS, so no frameworks needed! Just fire up an http server of your choice, like: 
[http-server])https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and navigate to [index.html](index.html).
